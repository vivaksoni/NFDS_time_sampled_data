# NFDS_time_sampled_data
Repository for Soni 2025: "Can ancient DNA and other forms of time-sampled data aid in the inference of negative frequency dependent selection?"


Scripts directory contains SLiM scripts to run simulations to reproduce data for Figures 1-3, as well as R scripts to run ABC inference, and python script for calculating summary statistics from vcf files. Finally, plot_figures.ipynb contains jupyter notebook for plotting figures.

selection_trajectories.tar.gz contains mutation frequencies and estimates of Tajima's D and haplotype diversity from simulated data to produce Figure 1.

contraction_stats.tar.gz contains summary statistics from population contraction simulations to produce Figure 2.

ABC.tar.gz contains information on parameter draws for simulation for Figure 3, as well as summary statistics for each of the population histories, and also the empirical summary statistics.
